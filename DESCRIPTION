Title: Creates a Schedule For Two Sets of People
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Brian C. O'Meara
Maintainer: Brian C. O'Meara <omeara.brian@gmail.com>
Description: A typical (and original) use case for this is
    potential students meeting with faculty. The students have faculty
    they must meet with and faculty they want to meet with, as well as
    scheduling constraints. The faculty also have scheduling constraints.
    This will create a 3D array (axes are students, faculty, and times)
    with meetings filling the cells. The idea is one of hosts (in this
    case, faculty) who stay in their rooms, and guests (students) who roam
    around.
